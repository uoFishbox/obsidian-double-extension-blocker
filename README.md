# Obsidian Anti PDFmd Plugin

This plugin prevents the automatic creation of `.pdf.md` files when opening unresolved `.pdf` links in Obsidian.

## Features:
- Stops `.pdf.md` file generation
- Customizable: Add other file extensions to prevent `.md` creation
- Compatible with desktop and mobile devices

If you temporarily need to create a note in the `{extension}.md` format, please create the note under a different name and then rename it accordingly.
